# Storage Cores
A next generation rewrite of [Expanded Storage](https://github.com/CompassSystem/expanded-storage) focusing on a few QOL improvements.
1. Storage containers will contain upgradable cores which can be placed into other compatible containers.
2. Visual styles can be used regardless which tier the storage core is with a new advancement based system to unlock new styles.
3. New redstone interactions which still needs to be planned out.
